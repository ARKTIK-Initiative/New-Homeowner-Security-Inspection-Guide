# Home Security Inspection Checklist

Welcome to your Home Security Inspection Checklist! Use this guide to perform a preliminary assessment of your home’s security. This checklist covers essential areas to help identify any potential vulnerabilities, improve protection, and prepare for a professional security consultation.

## 1. Exterior Doors

- [ ] **Secure Locks**: Ensure all exterior doors have deadbolts and secure locks. Consider upgrading to keyless digital locks to prevent unauthorized access.
- [ ] **Door Sensors**: Verify that door sensors are installed and operational. These are essential for monitoring entry points.
- [ ] **Reinforced Frames**: Check that door frames are reinforced, as weak frames can be an easy target for forced entry.
- [ ] **ADT Signage**: Place an ADT security sign near the front entrance as a deterrent to potential intruders.

## 2. Windows and Glass Doors

- [ ] **Window Locks**: Confirm that all windows are equipped with locks and are secure when closed.
- [ ] **Window Sensors**: If window sensors are installed, check that they are functioning properly. Window sensors provide additional protection against unauthorized access.
- [ ] **Reinforced or Laminated Glass**: For ground-floor windows, consider reinforced or laminated glass for extra security.
- [ ] **Clear Visibility**: Trim any landscaping or bushes that obstruct windows, as these can provide cover for potential intruders.

## 3. Security Cameras

- [ ] **Positioning**: Ensure cameras are strategically placed at key entry points, including the front door, back door, and garage.
- [ ] **Blind Spots**: Check for any blind spots around the property and adjust camera angles if needed.
- [ ] **Video Quality**: Test camera feeds for clear video quality, especially at night. High-quality footage can be crucial for identifying intruders.
- [ ] **Privacy and Encryption**: Confirm that your cameras are connected to an encrypted network, ensuring only authorized individuals can view the footage.

## 4. Exterior Lighting

- [ ] **Motion-Activated Lights**: Install motion-activated lights around entry points, driveways, and pathways. Proper lighting deters intruders and improves visibility.
- [ ] **Adequate Coverage**: Ensure there are no dark areas around your property, especially near entrances and exits.
- [ ] **Smart Lighting Options**: Consider installing smart lighting that can be controlled remotely. ADT systems offer integration with smart home lighting for convenience and security.

## 5. Alarms and Sensors

- [ ] **Door and Window Sensors**: Test all entry point sensors to confirm they are working correctly.
- [ ] **Glass Break Detectors**: If you have glass break detectors, verify that they are functioning and placed in vulnerable areas.
- [ ] **Motion Sensors**: Check that motion sensors are positioned in high-traffic areas within the home, such as hallways and common rooms.

---

## 6. Fire, CO, and Water Leak Detection

- [ ] **Smoke Detectors**: Confirm that smoke detectors are installed and have fresh batteries. Test each detector to ensure it is operational.
- [ ] **Carbon Monoxide (CO) Detectors**: Check that CO detectors are installed, especially near sleeping areas, and are in good working condition.
- [ ] **Water Leak Sensors**: Consider adding water leak sensors in areas prone to water damage, such as basements, laundry rooms, and kitchens.

---

## 7. Network and Data Security

- [ ] **Secure Wi-Fi Network**: Ensure your Wi-Fi network is password-protected and encrypted. A secure network prevents unauthorized access to your security system and devices.
- [ ] **Device Encryption**: Verify that all connected devices, including cameras and smart home systems, are encrypted for data security.
- [ ] **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Enable two-factor authentication for any apps or accounts associated with your security system for added protection.

---

## 8. Garage and Outdoor Areas

- [ ] **Garage Door Security**: Ensure garage doors are equipped with secure locks and, if possible, are monitored by sensors or cameras.
- [ ] **Outdoor Structures**: Secure any sheds or outdoor storage areas to prevent unauthorized access to tools or equipment that could be used for break-ins.
- [ ] **Gate Locks and Sensors**: If applicable, check that gates have secure locks and are monitored by sensors.

---

## 9. Emergency Preparedness

- [ ] **Backup Power Supply**: Confirm that your security system has battery backup or cellular support to stay operational during power outages.
- [ ] **ADT Contact Information**: Keep ADT’s contact information easily accessible in case of an emergency or system issue.
- [ ] **Emergency Plan**: Develop a family emergency plan, including a safe room, exit strategy, and emergency contacts.

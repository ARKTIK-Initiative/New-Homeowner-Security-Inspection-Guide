## How Security Systems Reduce Insurance Costs

Insurance companies recognize that homes with professional security systems are less likely to experience break-ins, theft, or damage. By lowering the risk of these costly events, they reward policyholders with **2-5% or more in annual savings** on their homeowners insurance premiums.

### Key Insurance Savings Benefits:
- **Lower Risk of Theft and Property Damage**: Professionally monitored systems reduce the likelihood of these events.
- **Added Fire and Flood Protection**: Some systems include options for smoke, fire, and flood detection, providing additional protection and potential discounts.
- **Evidence for Insurance Claims**: Security system logs and camera footage can provide documentation if a claim is needed.

## Qualifying for Insurance Discounts

To qualify for insurance discounts with your security system, follow these steps:

1. **Install an ADT Monitored Security System**  
   - Work with a certified ADT professional to install a security system that meets insurance requirements. ADT’s systems include **24/7 monitoring**, **direct dispatch to emergency services**, and **backup options** that keep your system running even during outages.
  
2. **Obtain a Certificate of Installation**  
   - Once your system is installed, request a **Certificate of Installation** from ADT. This certificate verifies that your home is professionally monitored and may be required by your insurance provider to apply any discounts.

3. **Submit the Certificate to Your Insurance Provider**  
   - Contact your insurance company or agent and submit the certificate for review. Each provider has specific requirements, so check with them on the best way to apply this document to your policy.

4. **Ask About Additional Savings**  
   - If your system includes fire and smoke detection, carbon monoxide monitoring, or water damage sensors, ask your provider about further discounts. ADT offers comprehensive systems that may qualify for additional savings.

## Essential Tips for Community Security

### 1. Establish a Neighborhood Watch
   - **Regular Check-Ins**: Host monthly or quarterly meetings to discuss recent activity, review protocols, and foster a sense of community vigilance.
   - **Private Communication Channel**: Use a secure, private messaging app to keep residents informed about suspicious activities or events.

### 2. Improve Community Lighting
   - **Motion-Activated Lights**: Ensure that entrances, pathways, and parking areas are well-lit, particularly around community spaces like golf courses and clubhouses.
   - **HOA or Club-Sponsored Lighting**: Develop a lighting program to ensure common areas, including tennis courts and parking facilities, are well-illuminated.

### 3. Visible Security Measures for Community Facilities
   - **Install Security Cameras**: Place cameras at key entry points to golf courses, tennis courts, and country clubs to deter trespassers and monitor activity.
   - **ADT Monitoring for Clubhouses**: Consider ADT-monitored systems for country club and clubhouse facilities, enhancing security for members and guests.
   - **Coordinate with Local Law Enforcement**: Establish a relationship with local authorities, inviting them to offer security consultations for large community spaces.

### 4. Protect and Maintain Shared Amenities
   - **Lock and Monitor Facilities**: Secure community facilities such as tennis courts, storage areas, and golf course equipment sheds with high-quality locks and, where possible, cameras.
   - **Schedule Regular Patrols**: Arrange voluntary patrols or assign security staff to monitor these areas during peak hours to prevent unauthorized access.

### 5. Security for Country Clubs and Golf Courses
   - **Access Control**: Implement keycard or member-only access to private areas within the country club and golf course facilities.
   - **Perimeter Security**: Consider fencing or controlled access points around golf courses to prevent unauthorized access.
   - **Parking Area Surveillance**: Install cameras in parking areas to monitor entry and exit and prevent vehicle-related incidents.

### 6. Reporting Suspicious Activity
   - **Clear Reporting System**: Establish a process for reporting unusual activity, whether at homes or shared facilities, and ensure that residents and club members know how to report concerns.
   - **Engage Local Authorities**: Use non-emergency numbers for reporting non-urgent issues, fostering a relationship with local law enforcement that benefits the entire community.

## Essential Tips for Community Security

### 1. Establish a Neighborhood Watch
   - **Regular Check-Ins**: Organize monthly or quarterly meetings to discuss recent activity and set up protocols.
   - **Secure Communication**: Use a private messaging app to quickly inform neighbors about suspicious activities.

### 2. Improve Community Lighting
   - **Install Motion-Activated Lights**: Encourage homeowners to install lighting at entrances and around shared spaces.
   - **Community Lighting Programs**: For HOAs, consider a lighting program to keep all common areas well-lit.

### 3. Promote Visible Security Measures
   - **Encourage Camera Use**: Visible cameras serve as effective deterrents and can be invaluable in investigations.
   - **Coordinate with Law Enforcement**: Invite local police to share advice and support neighborhood security initiatives.

### 4. Protect Shared Spaces
   - **Lock and Monitor Facilities**: Secure shared amenities like storage areas and clubhouses with locks and, if possible, security cameras.
   - **Organize Community Patrols**: Arrange voluntary patrols or rotations for added visibility and deterrence.

### 5. Report Suspicious Activity
   - **Maintain Contact with Local Authorities**: Use non-emergency numbers to report incidents that arenâ€™t urgent but warrant attention.
   - **Clear Reporting Process**: Set up a neighborhood system for residents to easily report unusual activity.

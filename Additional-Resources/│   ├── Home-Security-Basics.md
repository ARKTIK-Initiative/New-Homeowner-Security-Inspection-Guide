## 1. Secure All Entry Points

Entry points, such as doors and windows, are often the first places intruders attempt to access. Reinforcing these areas is essential for home security.

- **Deadbolts and Secure Locks**: Ensure all doors have strong, reliable locks. Deadbolts are a great addition for exterior doors, providing extra security.
- **Smart Locks**: For additional control, consider installing smart locks, which allow you to lock and unlock doors remotely.
- **Window Locks**: Secure all windows with locks, especially those on the ground floor or near accessible areas.

## 2. Install a Security System

A professionally monitored security system is one of the most effective ways to protect your home. Here’s why a monitored system, like ADT, adds significant value:

- **24/7 Monitoring**: Professional monitoring ensures that emergency responders are notified if a security breach occurs.
- **Deterrent Effect**: Visible signs of a security system, such as ADT signs and window stickers, discourage potential intruders.
- **Fast Emergency Response**: Monitored systems provide direct dispatch to local authorities, leading to faster response times in the event of an emergency.

## 3. Improve Exterior Lighting

Proper lighting around your home is a simple but powerful deterrent to unauthorized access.

- **Motion-Activated Lights**: Install motion-sensor lights around entrances, driveways, and pathways. These lights automatically turn on when motion is detected, helping to deter intruders.
- **Smart Lighting**: Consider integrating smart lighting that you can control remotely and schedule, giving you visibility and control even when you’re away.
- **Landscape Lighting**: Illuminate areas near windows and doors, especially those obscured by landscaping, to eliminate hiding spots.

## 4. Use Security Cameras

Security cameras provide valuable visibility around your home and can be a major deterrent to crime.

- **Camera Placement**: Position cameras at key entry points, such as the front door, back door, and garage, and check for any blind spots.
- **Remote Access**: With remote viewing via a mobile app, you can monitor your home’s surroundings in real-time, even while away.
- **Encrypted Video Feeds**: Choose cameras with encryption to protect your footage and privacy.

## 5. Secure the Garage and Outdoor Structures

Garages, sheds, and other outdoor structures often contain valuable items or tools that could be used for forced entry.

- **Garage Door Security**: Ensure that garage doors have secure locks and consider adding a sensor for monitoring.
- **Secure Sheds and Storage**: Lock sheds and storage areas to prevent access to tools or equipment.
- **Install a Camera**: If possible, add a camera to monitor the garage area and keep an eye on any outdoor structures.

## 6. Develop an Emergency Plan

Creating a clear emergency plan for your household can make all the difference in a crisis.

- **Designate a Safe Room**: Choose a secure area in your home where everyone can gather during an emergency.
- **Exit Strategy**: Ensure all family members know how to safely exit the home if needed.
- **Emergency Contacts**: Keep a list of emergency contacts, including local police, fire department, and your security provider (like ADT).

## 7. Protect Your Digital Privacy

With today’s smart home devices, digital security is as important as physical security. Here are some tips:

- **Secure Wi-Fi Network**: Set a strong password for your Wi-Fi network and enable network encryption.
- **Two-Factor Authentication**: Use two-factor authentication (2FA) for apps connected to your security system.
- **Device Encryption**: Make sure that any security cameras or smart devices are encrypted to prevent unauthorized access.

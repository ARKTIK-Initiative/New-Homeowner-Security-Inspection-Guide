## Core Security Principles

### 1. Secure Entry Points
   - **Reinforced Doors and Locks**: Install deadbolts and high-quality locks on all exterior doors.
   - **Window Locks**: Secure all windows, especially on lower floors.
   - **ADT Signage**: Display ADT signs near entry points as a visible deterrent.

### 2. Surveillance and Monitoring
   - **Security Cameras**: Position cameras at key entry points, ensuring a comprehensive view of your property.
   - **24/7 Monitoring**: A professionally monitored system, such as ADT, provides peace of mind with continuous protection.

### 3. Exterior Lighting
   - **Motion-Activated Lights**: Place lights around your propertyâ€™s perimeter and at entry points.
   - **Smart Lighting Options**: Integrate with a smart home system for convenient control and scheduling.
